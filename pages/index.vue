    <h1>About Opepen</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      The Opepen protocol is an innovative approach to digital art within the Web3 space,
      created by artist Jack Butcher. It's characterized by its unique minting and
      evolution process, which revolves around an "open edition" NFT collection.
      Here's how it works:
    </p>

    <p>
      Minting and Evolution: Initially launched in January 2023, Opepen started with an
      open edition mint where 16,000 NFTs were minted for free, excluding gas fees.
      Unlike traditional NFT projects where value is often derived from scarcity,
      Opepen introduces a system where the art evolves through a series of drops.
      Each drop requires a certain level of demand (at least 200% of the
      collection size must opt-in) for the artwork to be revealed,
      creating rarity within an open edition framework.
    </p>

    <p>
      Market Impact: Since its inception, Opepen has achieved significant recognition
      in the NFT market. It has been auctioned at Sotheby's, underscoring its acceptance
      and value in traditional art auction settings. Moreover, the collection has seen
      substantial trading volume, with over 80,000 ETH traded, establishing it as one
      of the biggest art collections on the Ethereum blockchain. This trading volume
      reflects both the community's engagement with the project and the speculative
      investment interest in Butcher's approach to digital art.
    </p>

    <p>
      Community and Cultural Impact: Opepen isn't just about the art; it's also about
      community participation. The opt-in system for reveals fosters a sense of
      involvement and anticipation among collectors. This project has also
      sparked discussions and trends on platforms like X, where it's
      celebrated for its innovative approach to digital art
      and community-driven evolution.
    </p>

    <p>
      The combination of these factors - the unique minting process, significant
      trading volume, high-profile auction placements, and a strong community
      engagement - positions Opepen as a landmark project
      in the realm of Ethereum-based art NFTs.
